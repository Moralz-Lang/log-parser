# 🔐 Security Log Normalization Pipeline

## Overview

This project demonstrates how real security logs generated by Windows and Linux systems can be normalized into structured JSON.

The pipeline focuses on ingesting native operating system logs and preparing them for analysis, SIEM ingestion, and scalable processing workflows.

No synthetic or generated log data is used.

---

## Objectives

- Collect native OS security logs
- Normalize unstructured log data
- Support Windows and Linux environments
- Demonstrate SOC-style preprocessing techniques
- Build foundations for scalable data analysis

---

## Technologies

- Python 3
- Regular Expressions
- JSON
- Windows Event Logs (Security)
- Linux authentication logs (auth.log)

---

## Log Sources

### Windows
- Windows Event Viewer → Security log
- Exported using `wevtutil`

### Linux
- `/var/log/auth.log`
- SSH and authentication activity

See `docs/log_sources.md` for details.

---

## How the Pipeline Works

1. Logs are generated by the operating system
2. Logs are exported or copied locally
3. Python parses unstructured entries
4. Key fields are extracted and normalized
5. Output is written as JSON

---

## Running on Windows

### Export Logs
Run PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
wevtutil qe Security /f:text > security.log
